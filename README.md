The advent of the digital revolution and progress in medical research have brought about a period of ample patient data, including clinical factors, hospital resources, sickness diagnosis information, patient records, and medical equipment data. In order to account for the possible differences in how diseases present themselves in different regions and contexts, it is crucial to include not just disease-related information but also data on the patient's living environment and other pertinent environmental elements in datasets. An accurate diagnosis and prediction of outcomes need the examination of extensive, intricate, and all-encompassing data.

Inaccuracies in illness prediction algorithms may pose a risk to patients' lives or well-being. This work aims to meet the pressing need for exceptionally precise prediction algorithms by optimizing model parameters and integrating various models into a unified system that can be accessed by both patients and clinicians. The method enables users to enter essential factors pertaining to their sickness, while the computer assesses if their state aligns with a certain disease. Due to the variation in symptoms across various illnesses, the criteria for each condition are recorded individually. The system is portrayed as an instinctive online application with user-friendly functionalities and a straightforward user interface, which helps users save time and exert less effort.

Enhanced illness prediction may result in improved disease detection rates, which in turn can lead to higher life expectancy and lower healthcare expenses. To accomplish this objective, a range of machine learning methods, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and KNN, were used.
